      - 'I(absent) - A machine matching the specified name will be stopped and removed.'
      - 'I(present)" - Asserts the existence of a machine matching the name and any provided configuration parameters.
         If no machine matches the name, a container will be created. If a machine matches the name but the provided
         configuration does not match, the machine will be updated, if it can be. If it cannot be updated, it will be
         removed and re-created with the requested config. Use the recreate option to force the re-creation of the
         matching machine.'
      - 'I(started) - Asserts there is a running machine matching the name and any provided configuration. If no machine
         matches the name, a machine will be created and started. If a container matching the name is found but the
         configuration does not match, the container will be updated, if it can be. If it cannot be updated, it will be
         removed and a new container will be created with the requested configuration and started. Use recreate to
         always re-create a matching container, even if it is running. Use restart to force a matching machine to be
         stopped and restarted.'
